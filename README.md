# craftercms-react-blueprint
A simple boilerplate blueprint for a CrafterCMS (3.x) site using React

## Instructions

You need a [CrafterCMS](https://github.com/craftercms/craftercms) install with the server up. As soon as you create the site, the preview window will show an error page - this is normal (see steps 8 & 9 below).

1. Head to `127.0.0.1/studio` and login
2. Click `Create Site` button
3. Give your site a name
4. Click `Link to upstream remote Git repository`
5. Give this repo a name entering it on the `Remote Git Repository Name` field (e.g. blueprint)
6. Enter this repo's git URL in the `Remote Git Repository URL` field (https://github.com/rart/craftercms-react-blueprint.git)
7. Click the `Create` button
8. Once your site is created, head to your `site/sources/app` folder and run `yarn` (or `npm install`) to pull npm deps
9. Start the react server
10. Begin crafting :)
